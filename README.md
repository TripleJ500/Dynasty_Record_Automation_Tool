Once the application has been built, simply run it and select the stat files you want to update. You shouldn't need
to upload each file listed in the application, you should be able to only load the files you want and still update
your records. If you have an issue with not being able to load only a few files, let me know and I will investigate
it. The Record files (RBKN, RBKS), playaer file, and schedule file are mandatory. The application will not function
properly without all four of those files.

Once you have loaded the files you wanted, press the update button and boom; that's it! The process is pretty fast so 
you shouldn't have to wait long for the record files to be updated; a few seconds at most. I will eventually push a fix
to create a confirmation window once the process is done. The output school and NCAA records files will be generated 
inside of a folder labeled "Output". This folder will be created at the same location of the files you loaded.
